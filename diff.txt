What are some new things to try?
Allan's Blog
Take a class on a subject unrelated to your career, community, or familyâ€”something you've always been interested in, but never made the time to pursue.
Go to a new restaurant, preferably an ethnic restaurant and try something different on the menu.
Take a yoga class, if you've never done.
Meditate.
